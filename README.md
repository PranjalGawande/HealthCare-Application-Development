## Project Overview

**Health Sync** is a robust Hospital Management System developed to integrate seamlessly with the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) Sandbox. The primary objective of the project is to enhance the efficiency of healthcare operations by facilitating secure and interoperable health data exchange.

### Core Features

- **Patient Registration and ABHA ID Creation**: Implemented a feature to register patients and generate/verify their ABHA ID.
- **Consent Management**: Developed functionality to generate and manage consent requests between healthcare providers and patients.
- **Data Exchange**: Enabled secure transmission of patient records by demonstrating data sharing capabilities with ABDMâ€™s Personal Health Record (PHR) app.

## Methodology and Technical Aspects

- **Frontend Development**: Utilized ReactJS for a dynamic and interactive user interface, handling user interactions and connecting to the backend.
- **Backend Development**: Implemented using Java Spring Boot, featuring JWT token-based authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for security.
- **Integration Layer**: Developed to connect HIS with ABDM, enabling the exchange of health records, consent management, and interworking with the ABDM PHR app.
- **Security Measures**: Included JWT-based authentication, RBAC for access control, and comprehensive auditing and logging mechanisms to monitor system usage.

## Outcomes and Challenges

- **Achievements**: Successfully implemented core features such as patient registration, consent management, and data exchange with ABDM, adhering to privacy and data protection standards.
- **Challenges**: Encountered issues with ABDM APIs, which were partially addressed during the project.
